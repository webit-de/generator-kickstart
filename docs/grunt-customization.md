### grunt live

### grunt test
Runs all quality assurance tasks. This task can be used in a pre-commit hook to keep
the repository on a high level of quality.

## grunt -q / grunt -quite

## Customization of your grunt tasks

For each customizable task there is a ```.*rc```-file that you can use to make these tasks fit your needs.
